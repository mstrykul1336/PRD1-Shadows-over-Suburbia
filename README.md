PRD1 of Shadows Over Suburbia.

- Added multiplayer lobby functionality (two different types, one works better than the other)
- Made a game scene that breaks because the old lobby was messed up and now it doesn't work with the new lobby.
- Made basic title screen.
- Followed a bad guide that did not work and took up 4-5 hours of my time.
- Also the names don't show up on the lobby because I took the code from an old build in multiplayer that had those not working. Do not know how to fix it like I did last time.
